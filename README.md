## Noise on Transformers
This project contains code for simulating attention-based dynamics on the d-dimensional sphere with intrinsic adaptive noise. The key focus is to study the system and the effects of stochastic noise on the dynamics, given certain parameters.

This project can be run on any HPC cluster.
